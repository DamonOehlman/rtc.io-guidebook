An in-progress guidebook for building applications using [rtc.io](https://github.com/rtc-io).

## Getting Started

Install using the following command:

```
npm install -g rtc-guidebook
rtc-guidebook
```

If all is well a server will be started on your local machine and bound to port 3000, so available at the following url:

http://localhost:3000/guidebook/

If you would prefer to run the guidebook on a different url, then you can run the `rtc-guidebook` command, and provide a `NODE_PORT` environment variable:

```
NODE_PORT=8000 rtc-guidebook
```
